# 365 o' Code

Starting Jan 17, 2023, I'm all sorts of out of practice and my activity tracker is all sorts of barren.

All the misc. code I write will be done here in this repo. So CodeWars, Advent of Code, Leetcode, etc.
It's not a working directory, just a place to keep track of my code so I get the little dot on the GitHub activity tracker.
I guess an additional benefit is seeign the quality of my code change across time.
